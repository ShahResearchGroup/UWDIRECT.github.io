The instructors for CHEME/CHEM/MSE 545 and CHEME/CHEM/MSE 546 are dedicated to providing a welcoming, supportive and inclusive environment for all people, regardless of background and identity. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national origin or religion. Any form of behavior to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. 

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviors on all platforms and during all events, both in-person and online:
* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully provide and accept constructive criticism
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* Written or verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national origin or religion
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Sexual language or images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Sustained disruption of talks, events, or communications
* Insults or put downs
* Nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any course events or activities, either online or in-person. Participants violating these rules may be referred to the University for action.

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our programming for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report either personally or anonymously. To personally report, contact an instructor.

SafeCampus (206-685-7233) is also available at any time to anonymously discuss safety and well-being concerns for yourself and others. SafeCampus is the University of Washingtonâ€™s violence-prevention and response program, providing resources to UW students, staff, faculty and community members.
