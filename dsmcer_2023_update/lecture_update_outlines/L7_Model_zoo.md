# L7 Model zoo (1.5 period)

(60 min)
Go over what we have gone over, for completion, then add more. Each gets and image, and brief description.
Also rate on:
- complexity (ability to capture complex relationships)
- robustness (tendency to overfit)
- cost (cost to train and use ass data get bigger)

0. Distance methods
1. Regularized Linear models
2. Kernel methods
3. Support vectors
4. Tree methods
  - Random Forests
5. XGBoost

6. Neural Networks (40 min)
  - spend more time on this one, picture of neuron and its components
  - loss function
  - backprop and gradient descent (eg optimum is not analytical)
    - learning rate
    - epochs
    - batches
    - optimizer
