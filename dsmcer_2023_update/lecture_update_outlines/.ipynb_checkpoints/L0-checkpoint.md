# L0 (1 period) Introduction to DS and toy problems

1. DS in broad strokes
  - 3 parts (input data, model, output information), with image
  - we aim to create a "model" which is a mathematical relationship, that connects input data that we have to some new "output" that we desire.
  - we have to design this mathematical relationship to be most valuable to us
2. Toy dataset 1: HCEPDB
  - big set of solar active materials, with measurements on them
  - possible DS applications:
    - determine which materials are most similar
    - predict activity of new materials
3. Toy dataset 1: Cell type
  - taken in UW ChemE, Nance Lab by Helbrecht et al.
  - pictures were taken of different cell types, features were extracted from the pictures
  - possible DS applications
    - determine which cell types are structurely similar
    - predict cell type of future pictures
4. Toy dataset 3: DES data
  - taken in UW ChemE, Pozzo lab by Politi et al.
  - robot was used to mix and test different deep eutectic solvents
  - for one of X hydrogen bond donors mixed with one of Y Quaternary salts at a certain molar ratio, electrochemical activity was measured as well as if it solidifed or not
  - possible DS applications
    - interpolate activity at different molar ratios
    - predict activity of new mixtures
    - determine what sample to take next to maximize information
